Train an RL agent to play Flappy Bird using Pygame. Implement a reward system: positive for passing pipes, negative for collisions. The agent learns by interacting with the game, adjusting strategies for higher scores and longer survival. Evaluate performance with metrics like average score and gameplay duration, showcasing RL's potential.
